.. inclusion-marker-what-it-does-start
What it does
------------
Code to download GRB light-curves from internet archives (at the moment only BATSE implemented). The code is then able to create light-curves from either pre-binned data or time-tagged photon-event data. Light-curves may then be fitted with with pulse models, and further analysed.
